Congratulations.This is an important time of transition.In light of the current state of our country,I struggle to find the right words of wisdom for you today,so I am here today to talk to you, not as the former first lady,but as a real life person, a mother, a mentor,a citizen concerned about your future and the future of our country.Because right now, all that superficial stuff of titles and positions,all of that has been stripped away.And a lot of us are reckoning withthe most basic essence of who we are.Over these past couple of months,our foundation has been shaken.Not just by a pandemic that stole too many of our loved ones,up-ended our daily lives,and sent tens of millions into unemployment.But also by the rumbling of the age-old fault lines that our country was built on.The lines of race and power,that are now once again so nakedly exposed for all of us to grapple with.So, if any of you are scared,or confused or angry or just plain overwhelmed by it all,if you feel like you're searching for a lifeline just to steady yourself,you are not alone.I am feeling all of that, too.I think we all are.So I want you to know that it's okay to be confused,it's okay if you don't understand exactly what you're feeling.We're all sorting through this in real time.But here's the thing.While this period is certainly unprecedented,it is not a complete anomaly,simply some random coincidence to be dismissed.Now, what's happening right now is the direct resultof decades of unaddressed prejudice and inequality.The truth is,when it comes to all those tidy stories of hard work and self-determinationthat we like to tell ourselves about America,well, the reality is a lot more complicated than that.Because for too many people in this country,nomatter how hard they work,there are structural barriers working against themthat just make the road longer and rockier.And sometimes it's almost impossible to move upward at all.Because if you're required to work during a pandemic,but don't have enough protective equipment,or health insurance from your employer, or paid sick leave,well, what is more essential, your work, or your life?If you don't feel safe driving your own car in your own neighborhoodor going for a jog, or buying some candy at 7-Eleven,or bird watching,if you can't even approach the police without fearing for your life,well, then how do you begin to chart your own course?And as so often is the casethese questions compound upon themselves.So, if you're struggling already just to keep your head above water,if you're living in a constant state of fear,how much farther behind will you be after months in quarantineand without a job?These are uncomfortable questions.Questions that have dogged this country for generations,but are now staring us in the faceevery time we look at our phonesor hear helicopters circling our neighborhoods.And the tough part is nobody has all the answers.If my generation did,trust me, we'd have fixed all of this a long time ago.But that doesn't mean we should feel hopeless.Just the opposite.Because what we finally do have is focus.We see what's happening in stark relief.We see how these inequalitiesare playing out on our streets.And it's not just the communities most affectedby these challenges that see it now.It's folks all across the country,who, for too long, have had the luxury and privilegeof looking away.We all have no choice but to see what has been staring us in the facefor years, for centuries.So the question is, how will we respond?Like I said before, I don't have any easy answers for you.But I do have some lessons I wanna shareabout how to move forward in these tumultuous times.The first is this.Life will always be uncertain.It is a lesson that most of us get the chance to learnover the course of years and years, even decades,but one that you're learning right now.This is a time in your life when it feels like everything is turned upside down.And perhaps you're wishing that things could just go back to the way they were.Look, I've been there many times in my life.I felt it most profoundly when my father and my best friend diedwithin a year of each other.I was in my late 20s.And it felt like my whole worldwas collapsing in on itself.I would have given anything, anything to bring them back.But that experience gave me a kind of clarity.With everything in pieces around me,I had to forge a new path.A path, fortunately, more focused on meaning and service.So, graduates,I hope that what you're going through right nowcan be your wake-up call.That it pushes you, not just to thinkabout what kind of career you want to build,but what kind of person do you want to be?And here's the thing, you have the opportunityto learn these valuable lessons faster than the generations before you.And you can learn them together,as a cohort of young people ready to take on the world,nomatter how tumultuous it may be.And that leads me to my second lesson.In an uncertain world,time-tested values like honesty and integrity,empathy and compassion,that's the only real currency in life.Treating people right will never, ever fail you.Now, I'm not naive.I know that you can climb a long way up the ladderselling falsehoods and blaming others for your own shortcomings,shunning those with less privilege and advantage.But that is a heavy way to live.It deadens your spirit and it hardens your heart.May seem like a winning strategy in the short run,but trust me, graduates, that kind of life catches up to you.You rob yourself of the things that matter most,deep and loving connections with others,honest work that leads to lasting contributions to your community,the vibrancy that comes from a diversity of ideas and perspectives.The chance to leave this world a little better than you found it.Don't deprive yourselves of all that.There is no substitute for it.Instead, make a decisionto use your privilege and your voicefor the things that really matter.Which is my third lesson today,to share that voice with the rest of the world.For those of you who feel invisible,please know that your story matters.Your ideas matter.Your experiences matter,your vision for what our world can and should be matters.So don't ever, ever let anyone tell you that you're too angryor that you should keep your mouth shut.There will always be those who want to keep you silent,to have you be seen but not heard.Or maybe they don't even want to see you at all.But those people don't know your story.And if you listen to them, then nothing will ever change.So, it's up to you to speak upwhen you or someone you know isn't being heard.It's up to you to speak out against cruelty, dishonesty,bigotry, all of it.It's up to you to march hand in hand with your alliesto stand peacefully with dignity and purposeonthe front lines in the fight for justice.And here's the last part.It's up to you to couple every protestwith plans and policies,with organizing, and mobilizing, and voting.And that's my final piece of advice.Graduates, anger is a powerful force.It can be a useful force,but left on its own, it will only corrode and destroyand sow chaos on the inside and out.But when anger is focused, when it's channeled into something more,oh, that is the stuff that changes history.Dr. King was angry. Sojourner Truth was angry.Lucretia Mott, Cesar Chavez,the folks at Stonewall, they were all angry.But those folks were also driven by compassion,by principle, by hope.And so they took advantageof whatever resources they had in their own time.Thundering from the pulpit and the convention floor,penning letters from a jail cell,standing up for their rightsin the face of police violence.They built coalitions with folkslike them and different from them.They got fluent in the language of power.They sat down with leaders they disagreed withbecause they knew that if they wanted their vision to be made real,it needed to be made law.It needed to be voiced not just on the streets,but in the halls of power.It needed to be carried not just by the housekeeperand the shift worker, but by the senator and the congresswoman,and, yes, the President of the United States.So, graduates, it is your time now.And, look, our democracy isn't perfect.But I have travelled the worldand seen the governments and people in so many other countries.And I can tell you that our democracy is sturdy,and yes, it still works.But it doesn't work if you silence yourselves.It does not work if you disengage from the process.And we're seeing the consequences of that right now.But if you hold strong with the same faiththat carried all those giants before you toward real, measurable progress,you will change the course of history.So what does that mean for your time?It starts where change always starts.In your own home.In your own social circles.In your own neighborhoods.At your own dinner tables.Sometimes it's easier to stand with strangers at a protestthan it is to challenge someone in your own backyard.So, if you hear people expressing bigoted viewsor talking down to \"those people,\"it is up to you to call them out.Because we won't solve anythingif we're only willing to do what's easiest.We've got to make hard choices and sacrifices in our own lives.So if you're spending a lot of time just hashtagging and posting right now--That's useful, especially during a pandemic,but it's only a beginning.Go further.Send all your friends a link to register to vote.Text everybody you know to join you inexercising their constitutional right to protest.Ask yourself, \"Do you know where your polling place is?\"\"Do you know when your primary elections are held?\"\"Do you know how to request a mail-in ballot?\"\"Who are the incumbents and the candidates at every level of government?\"Not just president, but state representative,city council, prosecutor, sheriff.And don't just ask yourselves these questions.Ask your friends, your family.Ask everyone you see in your neighborhood.And while we're reaching out,please let's give everyone who's working toward progress,space to be themselves.Everybody's got to vote when the time comes.But the activism that leads up to that day comes in many forms.Some wanna march right up in front. Others prefer to stay back.Some kneel in the pews, others on the street corner.Some canvas their neighborhoods, others run for office.Some do an honest day's work and raise good kids,others chose to focus on their educationand use that degree to address these issuesand build a better life for themselves and those around them.Graduates, it's all important, and we need every bit of it.So we cannot allow our hurt and our frustrationto turn us against each other,to cancel somebody else's point of viewif we don't agree with every last bit of their approach.That kind of thinking only divides us and distracts us from our higher calling.It is the gum in the wheel of progress.Graduates, this is how you can finish the workthat the generations before you have started.By staying open and hopeful, even in the tough times.By channeling that discomfort you feel into activism,and a democracy that was designed to respond to those who vote.And here's the thing, I know you can do it.Because over these many years,I have seen exactly who you are.I've seen your creativity, and your talent,and your resourcefulness.I've seen you speaking out to end gun violence and fight climate change.I've seen you gathering donations for those in need during this pandemic.I have seen you marching with peace and with purpose.And that is why, even in tough times like these,you continue to be what gives me hope.Graduates, you all are exactly what we need right now,and for the years and decades to come.You're learning so much, so quickly.And I know that, not only can you do better than those who came before you,you will.So it's your time.I love you all.I believe in you all.I want you to be safe.And I can't wait to see you take the reins.Congratulations again on your graduation.God bless you.

</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>or bird watching,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>if you can&#39;t even approach the police without fearing for your life,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>well, then how do you begin to chart your own course?</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And as so often is the case</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>these questions compound upon themselves.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So, if you&#39;re struggling already just to keep your head above water,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>if you&#39;re living in a constant state of fear,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>how much farther behind will you be after months in quarantine</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and without a job?</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>These are uncomfortable questions.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Questions that have dogged this country for generations,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>but are now staring us in the face</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>every time we look at our phones</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>or hear helicopters circling our neighborhoods.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And the tough part is nobody has all the answers.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>If my generation did,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>trust me, we&#39;d have fixed all of this a long time ago.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But that doesn&#39;t mean we should feel hopeless.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Just the opposite.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Because what we finally do have is focus.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>We see what&#39;s happening in stark relief.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>We see how these inequalities</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>are playing out on our streets.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And it&#39;s not just the communities most affected</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>by these challenges that see it now.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It&#39;s folks all across the country,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>who, for too long, have had the luxury and privilege</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>of looking away.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>We all have no choice but to see what has been staring us in the face</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>for years, for centuries.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So the question is, how will we respond?</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Like I said before, I don&#39;t have any easy answers for you.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But I do have some lessons I wanna share</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>about how to move forward in these tumultuous times.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>The first is this.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Life will always be uncertain.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It is a lesson that most of us get the chance to learn</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>over the course of years and years, even decades,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>but one that you&#39;re learning right now.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>This is a time in your life when it feels like everything is turned upside down.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And perhaps you&#39;re wishing that things could just go back to the way they were.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Look, I&#39;ve been there many times in my life.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I felt it most profoundly when my father and my best friend died</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>within a year of each other.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I was in my late 20s.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And it felt like my whole world</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>was collapsing in on itself.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I would have given anything, anything to bring them back.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But that experience gave me a kind of clarity.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>With everything in pieces around me,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I had to forge a new path.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>A path, fortunately, more focused on meaning and service.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So, graduates,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I hope that what you&#39;re going through right now</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>can be your wake-up call.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>That it pushes you, not just to think</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>about what kind of career you want to build,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>but what kind of person do you want to be?</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And here&#39;s the thing, you have the opportunity</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>to learn these valuable lessons faster than the generations before you.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And you can learn them together,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>as a cohort of young people ready to take on the world,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=kc>no</span><span class=w> </span><span class=l>matter how tumultuous it may be.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And that leads me to my second lesson.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>In an uncertain world,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>time-tested values like honesty and integrity,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>empathy and compassion,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>that&#39;s the only real currency in life.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Treating people right will never, ever fail you.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Now, I&#39;m not naive.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I know that you can climb a long way up the ladder</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>selling falsehoods and blaming others for your own shortcomings,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>shunning those with less privilege and advantage.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But that is a heavy way to live.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It deadens your spirit and it hardens your heart.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>May seem like a winning strategy in the short run,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>but trust me, graduates, that kind of life catches up to you.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>You rob yourself of the things that matter most,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>deep and loving connections with others,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>honest work that leads to lasting contributions to your community,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>the vibrancy that comes from a diversity of ideas and perspectives.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>The chance to leave this world a little better than you found it.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Don&#39;t deprive yourselves of all that.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>There is no substitute for it.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Instead, make a decision</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>to use your privilege and your voice</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>for the things that really matter.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Which is my third lesson today,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>to share that voice with the rest of the world.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>For those of you who feel invisible,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>please know that your story matters.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Your ideas matter.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Your experiences matter,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>your vision for what our world can and should be matters.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So don&#39;t ever, ever let anyone tell you that you&#39;re too angry</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>or that you should keep your mouth shut.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>There will always be those who want to keep you silent,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>to have you be seen but not heard.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Or maybe they don&#39;t even want to see you at all.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But those people don&#39;t know your story.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And if you listen to them, then nothing will ever change.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So, it&#39;s up to you to speak up</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>when you or someone you know isn&#39;t being heard.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It&#39;s up to you to speak out against cruelty, dishonesty,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>bigotry, all of it.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It&#39;s up to you to march hand in hand with your allies</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>to stand peacefully with dignity and purpose</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=kc>on</span><span class=w> </span><span class=l>the front lines in the fight for justice.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And here&#39;s the last part.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It&#39;s up to you to couple every protest</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>with plans and policies,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>with organizing, and mobilizing, and voting.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And that&#39;s my final piece of advice.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Graduates, anger is a powerful force.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It can be a useful force,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>but left on its own, it will only corrode and destroy</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and sow chaos on the inside and out.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But when anger is focused, when it&#39;s channeled into something more,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>oh, that is the stuff that changes history.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Dr. King was angry. Sojourner Truth was angry.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Lucretia Mott, Cesar Chavez,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>the folks at Stonewall, they were all angry.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But those folks were also driven by compassion,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>by principle, by hope.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And so they took advantage</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>of whatever resources they had in their own time.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Thundering from the pulpit and the convention floor,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>penning letters from a jail cell,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>standing up for their rights</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>in the face of police violence.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>They built coalitions with folks</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>like them and different from them.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>They got fluent in the language of power.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>They sat down with leaders they disagreed with</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>because they knew that if they wanted their vision to be made real,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>it needed to be made law.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It needed to be voiced not just on the streets,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>but in the halls of power.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It needed to be carried not just by the housekeeper</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and the shift worker, but by the senator and the congresswoman,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and, yes, the President of the United States.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So, graduates, it is your time now.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And, look, our democracy isn&#39;t perfect.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But I have travelled the world</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and seen the governments and people in so many other countries.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And I can tell you that our democracy is sturdy,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and yes, it still works.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But it doesn&#39;t work if you silence yourselves.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It does not work if you disengage from the process.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And we&#39;re seeing the consequences of that right now.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But if you hold strong with the same faith</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>that carried all those giants before you toward real, measurable progress,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>you will change the course of history.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So what does that mean for your time?</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It starts where change always starts.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>In your own home.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>In your own social circles.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>In your own neighborhoods.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>At your own dinner tables.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Sometimes it&#39;s easier to stand with strangers at a protest</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>than it is to challenge someone in your own backyard.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So, if you hear people expressing bigoted views</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>or talking down to &#34;those people,&#34;</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>it is up to you to call them out.</span><span class=w>

</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>if we&#39;re only willing to do what&#39;s easiest.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>We&#39;ve got to make hard choices and sacrifices in our own lives.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So if you&#39;re spending a lot of time just hashtagging and posting right now--</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>That&#39;s useful, especially during a pandemic,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>but it&#39;s only a beginning.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Go further.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Send all your friends a link to register to vote.</span><span class=w>

</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Ask yourself, &#34;Do you know where your polling place is?&#34;</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=s2>&#34;Do you know when your primary elections are held?&#34;</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=s2>&#34;Do you know how to request a mail-in ballot?&#34;</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=s2>&#34;Who are the incumbents and the candidates at every level of government?&#34;</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Not just president, but state representative,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>city council, prosecutor, sheriff.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And don&#39;t just ask yourselves these questions.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Ask your friends, your family.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Ask everyone you see in your neighborhood.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And while we&#39;re reaching out,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>please let&#39;s give everyone who&#39;s working toward progress,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>space to be themselves.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Everybody&#39;s got to vote when the time comes.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>But the activism that leads up to that day comes in many forms.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Some wanna march right up in front. Others prefer to stay back.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Some kneel in the pews, others on the street corner.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Some canvas their neighborhoods, others run for office.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Some do an honest day&#39;s work and raise good kids,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>others chose to focus on their education</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and use that degree to address these issues</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and build a better life for themselves and those around them.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Graduates, it&#39;s all important, and we need every bit of it.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So we cannot allow our hurt and our frustration</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>to turn us against each other,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>to cancel somebody else&#39;s point of view</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>if we don&#39;t agree with every last bit of their approach.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>That kind of thinking only divides us and distracts us from our higher calling.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>It is the gum in the wheel of progress.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Graduates, this is how you can finish the work</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>that the generations before you have started.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>By staying open and hopeful, even in the tough times.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>By channeling that discomfort you feel into activism,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and a democracy that was designed to respond to those who vote.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And here&#39;s the thing, I know you can do it.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Because over these many years,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I have seen exactly who you are.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I&#39;ve seen your creativity, and your talent,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and your resourcefulness.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I&#39;ve seen you speaking out to end gun violence and fight climate change.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I&#39;ve seen you gathering donations for those in need during this pandemic.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I have seen you marching with peace and with purpose.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And that is why, even in tough times like these,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>you continue to be what gives me hope.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Graduates, you all are exactly what we need right now,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>and for the years and decades to come.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>You&#39;re learning so much, so quickly.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And I know that, not only can you do better than those who came before you,</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>you will.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>So it&#39;s your time.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I love you all.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I believe in you all.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>I want you to be safe.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>And I can&#39;t wait to see you take the reins.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>Congratulations again on your graduation.</span><span class=w>
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=w></span><span class=l>God bless you.</span><span class=w>
